<h2>about building</h2>
<section>
    <blockquote cite="https://chhagan1490.github.io/mrideekyadav2.github.io">A building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in
        one place, such as a house or factory. In recent years, interest in sustainable planning and
        building practices has also becomean intentional part of the design process of many new building
        s and other structures.
        if a building is high enough, it can have more than one floor. People can climb from one floor
        to the next by a staircase,or perhaps by a lift or elevator. This is known as going upstairs,or
        downstairs. Buildings can also have a floor under the ground.
        This is usually called a cellar or basement.
        Buildings can be beautiful or ugly, exciting or boring. Architects are people traineds to design
        buildings Their work is called architecture.
        and it can be an art form Look at the building where you are reading this Look at the shapes
        Look at the shapes and shadows. Is there enough light?
        Do called architecture and it can be an art form. Look at the building where you are
        reading this.</blockquote>
